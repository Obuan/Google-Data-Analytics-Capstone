# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study

## Project Overview

### Key Findings
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Identified and corrected data inconsistencies.
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure data quality.

2. **Descriptive Analysis:**
   - Utilized summary statistics to understand data distribution and central tendencies.
   - Created visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and bar charts to illustrate key data points and trends.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
   - Used scatter plots and heatmaps to visualize these relationships.
   - Discovered significant patterns and outliers that informed further analysis.

4. **Inferential Analysis:**
   - Applied statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to draw conclusions about the data.
   - Built regression models to predict outcomes and understand variable impacts.

5. **Data-Driven Insights:**
   - Derived actionable insights from the data analysis, including key trends and anomalies.
   - Identified opportunities for optimization and areas requiring attention.

### Recommendations
1. **Process Improvement:**
   - Implement data quality checks to ensure ongoing data integrity.
   - Streamline data collection processes to reduce inconsistencies and errors.

2. **Strategic Decision-Making:**
   - Use the insights from the analysis to inform strategic decisions.
   - Prioritize areas identified as high-impact for business growth and development.

3. **Further Analysis:**
   - Conduct deeper analysis on identified trends to uncover root causes.
   - Regularly update data models to reflect new data and insights.
